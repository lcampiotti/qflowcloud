# OneDrive[](#onedrive "Link to this heading")

## Introduction[](#introduccion "Link to this heading")

The purpose of this manual is to detail how to configure and integrate Qflow with OneDrive to allow interaction between both platforms, thus allowing you to perform operations on files hosted on the platform.

OneDrive has the following actions:

*   [Upload file](#id2)
    
*   [Get file](#id3)
    
*   [Delete file](#id4)
    
*   [Get preview link](#id5)
    

See [Actions](36.12-OneDriveConnector.html#id1) for the description and content of each one.

## Prerequisites[](#prerrequisitos "Link to this heading")

It is necessary to have a OneDrive account already created on the platform or create an account when configuring the connector. This can be done from the Microsoft site [here](https://www.microsoft.com/es/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage).

## Application parameter[](#parametro-de-aplicacion "Link to this heading")

To establish the connection it is necessary to have at least one **application parameter** (see [Application Parameters](15-QflowDesign.html#parametros-de-aplicacion)) that allows communication to be established between Qflow and OneDrive. This parameter can be created from the service task configuration in Qflow. (see [Configuring Connectors from a Service Task](35-ConnectorParameterConfig.html))

To create a OneDrive application parameter, the following steps are required as detailed below.

### Application parameter using OAuth[](#parametro-de-aplicacion-utilizando-oauth "Link to this heading")

This type of application parameter requires logging into OneDrive from Qflow. This is done in the connector configuration following the steps of the OAuth flow.

Once the previous steps have been completed,it will be possible to interact with OneDrive from Qflow.
