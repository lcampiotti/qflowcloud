# v5.2[](#v5-2 "Link to this heading")

**Features summary**

Version 5.2 incorporates diverse functionalities to improve the user experience in Qflow, such as providing a new site (Qflow Access) that is the access point for Qflow users, session sharing between tools, providing default process templates, answer multiple tasks in a simple way, among others. Furthermore, the system now has the ability to store attachments in a separate database.

Additionally, the product continues its constant evolution, including features requested by our clients and business partners, which makes their job easier in order to be able to do more in less time.

When the described feature has a high technical content, it will be indicated with the ([![technical-icon](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)) icon. Aside from this, if it was included as a fix for a previous version, it will be indicated in the following way: \[x.y\]. If you are a functional analyst, you can skip reading those news.

If you already have a workspace in Qflow cloud, you are already enjoying these features! Otherwise, analyze the plans at [https://qflowbpm.com/en/pricing/](https://qflowbpm.com/en/pricing/). If you already have an onpremise installation, to be able to enjoy the features of the new version, contact your account manager, who will be able to assist you in installing or updating the system. If you do not have an account manager, you can contact us by completing the form at the following URL: [https://qflowbpm.com/en/contact/](https://qflowbpm.com/en/contact/).

## General improvements[](#mejoras-generales "Link to this heading")

> 
> Fig. 55 New logos and names of Qflow tools[](#id3 "Link to this image")

### Centralized access to the product[](#unificacion-de-acceso-al-producto "Link to this heading")

Qflow Access, a new one-stop portal for seamless navigation across Qflow tools.

> [![Qflow login page](_images/QfAccess.png)](_images/QfAccess.png)
> 
> Fig. 56 Qflow login page[](#id4 "Link to this image")

In addition, from each tool it is possible to access the others that the user has access permission.

> [![Access to the different tools from Qflow Task](_images/SitesLinked.png)](_images/SitesLinked.png)
> 
> Fig. 57 Access to the different tools from Qflow Task[](#id5 "Link to this image")

To continue product access unification, tools login pages have been updated, maintaining a harmonious style between each other, only changing the main color.

> [![Login pages](_images/LoginViews.png)](_images/LoginViews.png)
> 
> Fig. 58 Login pages[](#id6 "Link to this image")

It is possible to display the company logo, uploading it in Qflow Admin, by updating the system parameter _Logo_.

More details on how to configure a system parameter can be seen at Qflow Admin - System parameters.

### Gravatar integration[](#integracion-con-gravatar "Link to this heading")

In the header of the different tools, the user’s profile photo is shown. The photos are linked to the user’s registered email and pulled from Gravatar.

> [![Qflow Task header showing *gravatar* picture](_images/HeaderWithGravatar.png)](_images/HeaderWithGravatar.png)
> 
> Fig. 59 Qflow Task header showing _gravatar_ picture[](#id7 "Link to this image")

Each person can associate their email at [https://gravatar.com](https://gravatar.com).

In case the email is not registered or this option has been disabled in Qflow Admin, the user’s initials will be shown instead.

> [![Qflow Task header showing the user initials](_images/HeaderWithInitials.png)](_images/HeaderWithInitials.png)
> 
> Fig. 60 Qflow Task header showing the user initials[](#id8 "Link to this image")

By default, the option to use gravatar will be enabled. If this is not desired, the system parameter _Use gravatar for profile picture_ needs to be updated in Qflow Admin.

### Browsing optimizations [![technical-icon](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)[](#optimizaciones-en-navegacion-technical-icon "Link to this heading")

The use of service workers is implemented in the Qflow tools (Task, Design, Team and Admin) to locally store static files that will be reused while browsing. This allows a more fluid users’ experience.

## Qflow Task[](#qflow-task "Link to this heading")

### Respond to multiple tasks in a simple way[](#responder-multiples-tareas-de-manera-simple "Link to this heading")

From the My Tasks view, it is possible to select multiple tasks that allow Quick Reply and respond to all of them with a common response. In addition, it is allowed to add a comment for all those who admit it or require it.

To be able to access this functionality, _Quick Response_ system column must be configured in the corresponding view. Similarly, if this functionality is not wanted, that column should be removed.

> [![Quick Response column configuration](_images/QuickRespose_RespondTasks.gif)](_images/QuickRespose_RespondTasks.gif)
> 
> Fig. 61 Quick Response column configuration[](#id9 "Link to this image")

Since it is possible to select multiple tasks, their progress will be visible in the lower right corner, where it is possible to view the tasks in process, in error and finished.

In addition, a complete view can be seen to check all the information more comfortably.

> [![Quick Response column configuration](_images/QuickRespose_Configuration.png)](_images/QuickRespose_Configuration.png)
> 
> Fig. 62 Quick Response column configuration[](#id10 "Link to this image")

More details on how to set up quick replies can be seen at [Qflow Task - Simple response](04-QflowTask.html#respuesta-rapida).

### Storage of attachments in external database [![technical-icon](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)[](#almacenamiento-de-adjuntos-en-base-de-datos-externa-onpremise-icon-2x-technical-icon "Link to this heading")

The content of system attachments can now be stored in an external database. It is possible to choose to store the flow attachments in: Qflow Database, External Database or Azure blob storage.

### Update of default web forms[](#actualizacion-de-formularios-por-defecto "Link to this heading")

By default, the start events, tasks, flow edit and flow information forms will use the one-column version.

## Qflow Design[](#qflow-design "Link to this heading")

### Pre-created templates[](#plantillas-de-proceso-pre-creadas "Link to this heading")

It is possible to start using any of our pre-created templates in a few minutes. The templates available so far are:

> *   Two-step approval
>     
> *   Vacations request
>     
> *   Employee selection
>     
> *   Expense reimbursement
>     
> *   Document approval
>     
> *   Purchase request
>     

For example, the vacations request process generates a template like the following:

> [![Vacations request process](_images/VacationRequestProcess.png)](_images/VacationRequestProcess.png)
> 
> Fig. 63 Vacations request process[](#id11 "Link to this image")

To use it, it is just necessary to set the template version as a production version in Qflow Design and start processes in Qflow Task.

More details about the pre-built templates can be seen at [Qflow Design - Process templates](15-QflowDesign.html#plantillas-pre-creadas).

### We are integrated with Sharepoint 365![](#nos-integramos-con-sharepoint-365 "Link to this heading")

It is possible to create Domains, Integrations and Application Parameters with Sharepoint 365. Therefore, it is possible to have a datum that selects an item from a Sharepoint 365 list and fill in other data from the selected one. It is also possible to insert new elements in the list through integrations.

More details about domains can be seen at [Qflow Design - Domains](15-QflowDesign.html#dominios). About integrations at [Qflow Design - Integrations](15-QflowDesign.html#integraciones).

### New domains created by default[](#nuevos-dominios-por-defecto "Link to this heading")

The following default domains are created in the root package:

> *   Hyperlink
>     
> *   Rich textbox
>     
> *   Password
>     
> *   Email
>     
> *   Phone
>     

### Bugs fixed[](#errores-corregidos "Link to this heading")

**If the note text is longer than 256 characters, it is cut off**

When in a Text Note a text larger than 256 characters, characters after 256 were lost.

## Qflow Team[](#qflow-team "Link to this heading")

### Send welcome email to new users[](#enviar-bienvenida-al-usuario-creado "Link to this heading")

When creating a new user, the welcome to Qflow will be sent via email with the access link to Qflow Access.

> [![Welcome email](_images/WelcomeQflowEmail.png)](_images/WelcomeQflowEmail.png)
> 
> Fig. 64 Welcome email[](#id12 "Link to this image")

The email will be sent as long as the new user created has been assigned a valid email and notification service.

The logo used can be customized, updating the value of the _Email Logo_ system parameter.

If desired, this functionality can be disabled by setting the _Notify user on creation_ system parameter to False.

### Default security provider configuration[](#configuracion-de-proveedor-de-seguridad-predeterminado "Link to this heading")

On the tool, it is possible to choose which will be the workspace’s default security provider. This will allow it to be pre-selected in login views.

> [![Default security provider](_images/DefaultSecurityProvider.png)](_images/DefaultSecurityProvider.png)
> 
> Fig. 65 Default security provider[](#id13 "Link to this image")

More details about security providers can be seen at [Qflow Team - Security providers](18-QflowTeam.html#proveedores-de-seguridad).

### Setting default properties for new users[](#configuracion-de-propiedades-por-defecto-para-nuevos-usuarios "Link to this heading")

It is possible to configure default properties for all new users through the Configuration section in the header menu.

> [![Select Properties for new users](_images/DefaultProperties_SelectUser.png)](_images/DefaultProperties_SelectUser.png)
> 
> Fig. 66 Select Properties for new users[](#id14 "Link to this image")

Currently, default roles and notification services can be configured, as shown in the following image.

> [![New user properties](_images/DefaultProperties_Configuration.png)](_images/DefaultProperties_Configuration.png)
> 
> Fig. 67 New user properties[](#id15 "Link to this image")

All new users will inherit these properties by default, but they can be modified on creation. This also applies to the user creation by web services.

### User panel improvements[](#mejoras-en-panel-de-usuario "Link to this heading")

The role configuration is shown, even when the panel is not expanded, allowing to configure roles in an agile way.

The group of configuration services is closed by default, since they are currently inherited from the default configuration, it is no longer necessary to configure it for each user.

## Backend[](#backend "Link to this heading")

### Updating mail notification styles based on workspace theme[](#actualizacion-de-estilos-de-notificaciones-de-correo-segun-tema-del-espacio-de-trabajo "Link to this heading")

The styles and logos used in the email notifications have colors associated with the workspace theme. For example, below an email sent can be seen:

> [![Qflow email](_images/ReminderEmail.png)](_images/ReminderEmail.png)
> 
> Fig. 68 Qflow email[](#id16 "Link to this image")

### Consider time zone in AddSubstitution in script task [![technical-icon](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)[](#contemplar-zona-horaria-en-addsubstitution-en-tarea-de-codigo-technical-icon "Link to this heading")

If the AddSubstitution method is used in a Script Task, it takes into account if the DateTime sent has Kind UTC, it will use the date stipulated in UTC, otherwise it will assume that the value is in the user’s calendar time zone.

More details on how the method works can be seen at [Scripting interface](10-ScriptingInterface.html#iscripthost).

### Bugs fixed[](#id1 "Link to this heading")

**Production version is not correctly being used in call activity**

After changing the production version of the selected template, it was starting the version that was in production at the time the call activity was configured.

## Qflow Admin[](#qflow-admin "Link to this heading")

### New system parameters [![technical-icon](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)[](#nuevos-parametros-de-sistema-technical-icon "Link to this heading")

For more and better customizations, the following system parameters have been added:

> *   Logo
>     
> *   Logo light version
>     
> *   Task logo
>     
> *   Mini task logo
>     
> *   Email logo
>     
> *   Use gravatar for profile picture
>     
> *   Notify user on creation
