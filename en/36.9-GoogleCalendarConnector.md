# Google Calendar[](#google-calendar "Link to this heading")

## Introduction[](#introduccion "Link to this heading")

The purpose of this manual is to detail how to configure and integrate Qflow with Google Calendar to allow interaction between both platforms, allowing you to create, update and delete Google Calendar events from Qflow.

Google calendar has the following actions:

*   [Create event](#id2)
    
*   [Update event](#id3)
    
*   [Delete event](#id4)
    

See [Actions](36.9-GoogleCalendarConnector.html#id1) to know the description and content of each one.

## Prerequisites[](#prerrequisitos "Link to this heading")

It is necessary to have a Google account and a workspace created on the Google platform. This can be done [here](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-console).

In addition, it is necessary to have a Google Workspace account and have Domain Delegation enabled. This can be enabled on your [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/).

## Application parameter[](#parametro-de-aplicacion "Link to this heading")

To establish the connection, it is necessary to have at least one **application parameter** (see [Application Parameters](15-QflowDesign.html#application-parameters)) that allows establishing communication between Qflow and Google Calendar. This parameter can be created from the service task configuration in Qflow. (see [Connector Configuration from a Service Task](35-ConnectorParameterConfig.html))

To create a Google Calendar application parameter, the following steps are required as detailed below.

### Application parameter using Domain Wide Delegation[](#parametro-de-aplicacion-utilizando-delegacion-en-todo-el-dominio "Link to this heading")

This type of application parameter requires the following parameter:

*   **User email**
    
*   **Project ID**
    
*   **Private key ID**
    
*   **Private key**
    
*   **Client email**
    
*   **Client ID**
    

To obtain them, the following steps must be followed:

1.  Access the [Google Resource Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager). Here we will create a new project by selecting Create Project.
    
    [![_images/CreateProjectButton.png](_images/CreateProjectButton.png)](_images/CreateProjectButton.png)
    
    Fig. 843 CREATE PROJECT button in Google Cloud resource manager[](#id5 "Link to this image")
    
2.  Type the name of the project and select the Location to which it will belong, then select CREATE. The example in the image below shows that the application is called QflowTestWiki and does not belong to any organization.

    Fig. 844 Project creation view in Google Cloud[](#id6 "Link to this image")
    
3.  Select our new project in the upper combobox.
    
    [![_images/SelectProject.png](_images/SelectProject.png)](_images/SelectProject.png)
    
    Fig. 845 Project selection view in Google Cloud[](#id7 "Link to this image")
    
4.  In the top search bar look for Google Calendar API, enter it and then click on ENABLE to enable said API in our project.

    Fig. 846 Button to enable Google Calendar API in our Google Cloud project[](#id8 "Link to this image")
    
5.  In the top search bar look for Service account. We will proceed to create a service account in charge of executing our interactions. In order to accomplish this select CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT.
    
    [![_images/CreateServiceAccount.png](_images/CreateServiceAccount.png)](_images/CreateServiceAccount.png)
    
    Fig. 847 Option for creating a service account in Google Cloud[](#id9 "Link to this image")
    
6.  Here we must complete Service Account ID. We also recommend completing Service Account Name and Service Account Description as shown in the image below.
    
    [![_images/CreateServiceAccount2.png](_images/CreateServiceAccount2.png)](_images/CreateServiceAccount2.png)
    
    Fig. 848 Service Account fields in Google Cloud[](#id10 "Link to this image")
    
7.  Return to the Service Accounts view, select the created service account and in the Actions section select Manage keys.
    
    [![_images/ManageKeys.png](_images/ManageKeys.png)](_images/ManageKeys.png)
    
    Fig. 849 Manage Keys option for service account in Google Cloud[](#id11 "Link to this image")
    
8.  In this new window we are going to select the Create new key option within the ADD KEY combobox.
    
    [![_images/CreateNewKey.png](_images/CreateNewKey.png)](_images/CreateNewKey.png)
    
    Fig. 850 Option to create a new key for a service account in Google Cloud[](#id12 "Link to this image")
    
9.  Here we select the JSON option and proceed to create the key. A JSON file will automatically be downloaded with the generated private key.
    
    [![_images/SelectJSONKey.png](_images/SelectJSONKey.png)](_images/SelectJSONKey.png)
    
    Fig. 851 Private key type selection[](#id13 "Link to this image")

    Fig. 852 Key download message generated in Google Cloud[](#id14 "Link to this image")
    
10.  We must write down the OAuth 2 client ID found in the service accounts view identified by the following image:
    
    [![_images/ClientId.png](_images/ClientId.png)](_images/ClientId.png)
    
    Fig. 853 Service account OAuth 2 client ID in Google Cloud[](#id15 "Link to this image")
    
11.  Now we will provide our service account with the necessary permissions for its proper functioning. Within our Google Workspace administrator console go to API Controls and select MANAGE DOMAIN-WIDE DELEGATION.
    
    [![_images/DomainWideDelegationButton.png](_images/DomainWideDelegationButton.png)](_images/DomainWideDelegationButton.png)
    
    Fig. 854 Option to configure domain-wide delegation in Google Workspace[](#id16 "Link to this image")
    
12.  Here we select Add New to add a new client in our domain-wide delegation configuration.
    
    [![_images/DomainWideDelegationAddNewButton.png](_images/DomainWideDelegationAddNewButton.png)](_images/DomainWideDelegationAddNewButton.png)
    
    Fig. 855 Button to add new client in domain-wide delegation configuration[](#id17 "Link to this image")
    
13.  Proceed to fill in the Client ID and OAuth Permissions fields with the client ID associated with the service account that we created previously and in OAuth Permissions we only add https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.
    
    [![_images/AddClientDomainWideDelegationAuth.png](_images/AddClientDomainWideDelegationAuth.png)](_images/AddClientDomainWideDelegationAuth.png)
    
    Fig. 856 Filling service account fields to authorize domain permissions[](#id18 "Link to this image")
    
14.  Finally, in the API Clients list we should see our new client added with the previous permission in its list.

Once the above steps are completed, it will be possible to create, update and delete events in Google Calendar from Qflow.
