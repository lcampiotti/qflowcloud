# Jira Cloud[](#jira-cloud "Link to this heading")

## Introduction[](#introduccion "Link to this heading")

The purpose of this manual is to detail how to configure and integrate Qflow with Jira Cloud to allow interaction between both platforms, allowing the creation, moving, editing, and deletion of issues, as well as adding comments.

Jira Cloud has the following actions:

*   [Create issue](#id1)
    
*   [Add comment to issue](#id2)
    
*   [Update due date on issue](#id3)
    
*   [Update priority on issue](#id4)
    
*   [Update issue status](#id5)
    
*   [Update assignee](#id6)
    
*   [Delete issue](#id7)
    

## Prerequisites[](#prerrequisitos "Link to this heading")

It is necessary to have an account in Jira Cloud and a workspace created on the platform. You can create an account [here](https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-software).

## Application parameter[](#parametro-de-aplicacion "Link to this heading")

To establish the connection, it is necessary to have at least one **application parameter** (see [Application parameters](15-QflowDesign.html#application-parameters)) that allows establishing communication between Qflow and Jira Cloud. This parameter can be created from the service task configuration in Qflow, where it is also used to establish communication between Qflow and Jira Cloud. (see [Connector Configuration from a Service Task](35-ConnectorParameterConfig.html))

To create a Jira Cloud application parameter, the following steps are required as detailed below.

### Application parameter using API Token[](#parametro-de-aplicacion-utilizando-api-token "Link to this heading")

This type of application parameter requires the following parameters:

*   **API Token**: It is a token that allows Qflow to connect to Jira Cloud, simulating being the user who generated it. Every action taken from Qflow will be shown as performed by the user who generated the token.
    
*   **Jira domain link**: It is the link of the Jira Cloud instance to which Qflow will connect. For example, a possible Jira Cloud instance could be [https://mycompany.atlassian.net](https://mycompany.atlassian.net).
    
*   **User email**: It is the email of the user who generated the token from Jira Cloud, the actions taken from the Qflow connector will be shown as performed by this user.
    

To obtain them, the following steps must be followed:

1.  Access the [API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) section of Jira Cloud.
    
2.  Select **Create API token**.

    Fig. 822 Create API token marked in the API Tokens section[](#id8 "Link to this image")
    
3.  Write a label to identify the token, for example, Qflow, and select Create.

    Fig. 823 Section to choose label and create API Token[](#id9 "Link to this image")
    
4.  Copy the generated token, which is the API token needed to configure the application parameter in Qflow. This completes the necessary steps on the Jira Cloud page.

    Fig. 824 Generated API Token[](#id10 "Link to this image")
    
5.  In Qflow Design, add the API Token in API Token, the team link in Jira domain link, and the email of the logged-in user when requesting the API Token in User email.

    Fig. 825 Required parameters from the application parameter added in Qflow[](#id11 "Link to this image")
    

Once the steps are completed, it will be possible to create, edit, move, delete issues, and add comments in Jira Cloud from Qflow.

## Actions[](#acciones "Link to this heading")

The following actions can be performed with Jira Cloud:

### Create issue[](#id1 "Link to this heading")

This action allows you to create an issue in Jira Cloud. The project name, issue type, and summary must be provided. Optionally, other parameters can be added, which are listed below. After creating the issue, a key is received that identifies the issue in Jira Cloud, allowing it to be edited, moved, deleted, and have comments added later.
