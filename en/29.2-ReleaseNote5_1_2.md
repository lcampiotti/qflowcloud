# v5.1.2[](#v5-1-2 "Link to this heading")

**Features summary**

Version 5.1.2 incorporates diverse functionalities to improve Q-flow’s user experience, such as the ability to “Remember user”, and simplified steps to start designing a process. On the other hand, the system is now able to store attachments in Azure Blob Storage.

## General improvements[](#mejoras-generales "Link to this heading")

### Remember user[](#recordar-usuario "Link to this heading")

A “Remember me” checkbox was added on the login screen of every site. This option allows remembering the session on the browser, so that you do not have to log in again after the browser is closed. This option is supported for Google and Microsoft login.

> 
> Fig. 69 Q-flow login page, with “Remember me” option[](#id3 "Link to this image")

### Q-flow Forum[](#foro-de-q-flow "Link to this heading")

The Q-flow forum is now available, the ideal place to ask questions and get support from the community and Q-flow specialists. Among other uses, you can request new features, consult about form design and report errors.

### Access to the forum from the sites[](#acceso-al-foro-desde-los-sitios "Link to this heading")

## Web site[](#sitio-web "Link to this heading")

### Attachment storage in Azure[](#almacenamiento-de-adjuntos-en-azure "Link to this heading")

The content of the system’s attachments is now stored in the cloud, by using Azure’s Blob Storage technology. Thanks to this change, inherent benefits of cloud storage are perceived. We can highlight the speed in accessing files and the management of the security of our data, since the service guarantees protection against malicious access and uses mechanisms such as redundancy to recover data in the case of any unforeseen problem.

### Fixed errors[](#errores-corregidos "Link to this heading")

**Work queue system views**

The default action is changed to “Edit” when double-clicking on a work queue view, from the system views listing.

**Error on empty decimal data with editable read only scope**

An error is fixed that prevented responding to a task that has an empty decimal type application data with “Editable read only” scope.

## Web BPM[](#bpm-web "Link to this heading")

### Check out graph when creating a template[](#dejar-grafo-desprotegido-al-crear-una-plantilla "Link to this heading")

When creating a new template, the template itself as well as the version are opened and the graph will be checked out by default.

> [![Check out graph after creating a template](_images/checkedoutGraph.png)](_images/checkedoutGraph.png)
> 
> Fig. 74 Check out graph after creating a template[](#id8 "Link to this image")

### Allow creating a container package when creating a template[](#permitir-crear-paquete-padre-al-crear-plantilla "Link to this heading")

When creating a new template from a package, there is now an option to “Create process container subpackage”. If the option is selected, a subpackage will be created in the currently selected package (which will have the same name as the template), and the template will be created in that new subpackage.

### Fixed errors[](#id1 "Link to this heading")

**Cross-site scripting (XSS) on system parameter history** [![technical-icon](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)](_images/TechnicalIcon1.png)

Controls were added on the system parameter’s history log to prevent the execution of JavaScript code from user inputs.

## Web OMM[](#omm-web "Link to this heading")

### Fixed errors[](#id2 "Link to this heading")

**“Work queue configuration saved” action without description**

A description for the entries created by configurating a work queue was added to the node log.

## Client Registration[](#client-registration "Link to this heading")

### Workspace[](#espacio-de-trabajo "Link to this heading")

The concept previously handled as “Tenant” is now referred to as “Workspace”.

### Change license in use[](#cambio-de-tipo-de-licencia-en-uso "Link to this heading")

It is now possible to change the license type that is being currently used. If it is changed to a license with a lower cost, the previous license is mantained until the end of its term. If the license is changed to one with a higher cost, the new license will start in the moment, adjusting the billing date if it corresponds. A proration is made in order to calculate the new billing date, which depends on the difference in costs between the licenses.

### Allow manual payment with wire transfer[](#permitir-pago-manual-con-transferencia-bancaria "Link to this heading")

When creating a workspace, the option to make the payment by a wire transfer is now available. When you select this option, the team will contact you to finalize the payment and continue with the creation of the workspace.

### Other improvements[](#otras-mejoras "Link to this heading")
