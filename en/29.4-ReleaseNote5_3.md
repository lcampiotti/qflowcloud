# v5.3[](#v5-3 "Link to this heading")

**Feature summary**

The highly anticipated version 5.3 of Qflow brings a series of improvements and new functionalities to enrich your user experience. Among these, the incorporation of an artificial intelligence assistant for the generation and automation of business processes stands out. Additionally, users external to the system can now initiate processes, a new view allows easy access to responded tasks for each user, and the quick response to tasks feature has been improved, among other features.

With these additions, Qflow positions itself at the forefront of technology, leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence to offer a new way of approaching business process creation. Furthermore, we continue to pay attention to feedback from our users and business partners, incorporating features that add value to their experience with our platform. To contribute suggestions or comments for improving our product, you can post on the [Qflow forums](https://forum.qflowbpm.com/).

## Artificial intelligence assistant for business process generation[](#asistente-de-inteligencia-artificial-para-la-generacion-de-procesos-de-negocio "Link to this heading")

You now have an artificial intelligence assistant that generates and automates processes in Qflow. This assistant, powered by ChatGPT, can generate and automate processes based on a natural language description. This description can be simple and abstract, such as “Standard purchase request process”, or more detailed, including a series of steps, data, and specific roles to achieve a precise and tailored process according to your needs, such as: Purchasing request process in which applicants enter a list of items with quantities, shipping address and contact information, then going through an approval from the purchasing manager and dispatch notification if the transaction is confirmed.

> [![AI assistant form](_images/53News_AIAssistantForm.gif)](_images/53News_AIAssistantForm.gif)
> 
> Fig. 46 AI assistant form[](#id1 "Link to this image")

The AI assistant is responsible for creating the process diagram in BPMN notation, as well as defining data, roles, and step configurations, such as exclusive gateway conditions and data to be completed in forms.

It’s important to note that this assistant is in its initial implementation and is based on artificial intelligence, so it may occasionally present errors, which will be reduced as the tool learns from our users’ experiences. If the results do not meet your expectations, you can try generating the process again with the same description or try a different one. We invite you to read our tips on how to write to the assistant to achieve better results in process generation. In this initial version, each workspace will be limited to 100 uses of the assistant per month.

To learn more about the artificial intelligence assistant, you can read [the assistant’s section](15-QflowDesign.html#aiassistant) on the Qflow Design manual.

## Initiating processes by external or anonymous users[](#inicio-de-procesos-por-usuarios-externos-o-anonimos "Link to this heading")

Starting from this version, individuals who do not have a Qflow account can initiate processes. This functionality is particularly beneficial in contexts such as:

> *   Contact requests
>     
> *   Application in personnel selection processes
>     
> *   Conducting surveys
>     
> *   Initiating invoice approval by external suppliers
>     
> *   Registration for events or conferences
>     
> *   Requests for budgeting
>     
> *   Customer complaint submissions
>     
> *   And many more!
>     

Additionally, by accessing the public form of the process, even those users who have logged in to Qflow can initiate a process a process anonymously. This allows the use of Qflow for scenarios like:

> *   Anonymous reports
>     
> *   Suggestions box
>     

It’s also possible to configure a customized confirmation message for each process, which will be displayed to the user once they have successfully completed the form and initiated the process (see [Fig. 48](#externalstartconfirmationmessagefigure)).

For more details on how to allow a process to be started by external users, you can read the [start event configuration section](15-QflowDesign.html#starteventdesign). For information on the consumption of points by processes started by external users, see the [related documentation](21-Q-pointsConsumption.html).

## New view: “Tasks responded by me”[](#nueva-vista-tareas-respondidas-por-mi "Link to this heading")

A new view called “Tasks responded by me” has been introduced, easily accessible from the side menu. This view is specifically designed to quickly access tasks to which you have responded in the past.

Within this view, you’ll be able to efficiently view key information about the tasks you’ve addressed. This includes details such as the task’s subject, start date, response date, your response, and the current status of the task.

> 
> Fig. 49 New view: “Tasks responded by me”[](#id4 "Link to this image")

Consistent with the characteristic flexibility of all Qflow ystem views, this new functionality is fully customizable in your workspace. This means you can add filters, incorporate or adjust columns, set sorting criteria, and more, to tailor the view to your preferences and specific requirements.

## Quick response in customized “My Tasks” views[](#respuesta-rapida-en-vistas-personalizadas-de-mis-tareas "Link to this heading")

In [version 5.2 of Qflow](29.3-ReleaseNote5_2.html), the functionality to directly respond to one or multiple tasks from the “My Tasks” system view was implemented, in cases where tasks allowed it, without requiring access to the corresponding form.

In this latest update, the quick response feature has been extended to all custom views that users have created, as long as these views belong to the “My Tasks” category. This new functionality provides the opportunity to make quick responses in specific views, where users have configured columns to display all essential information needed for decision-making. you can read more about the feature on the [Quick response](04-QflowTask.html#quickresponse) section.

This way, you can leverage quick responses in broader contexts, streamlining your interactions and decisions regarding assigned tasks and allowing for more efficient management.

## New column formatters for custom views[](#nuevos-formatos-de-columnas-para-vistas-personalizadas "Link to this heading")

In order to more easily visualize the current status of tasks and the current stage of a process in custom views, new display formatters have been added:

> *   Show the status of the current stage of the process
>     
> *   Show the current status of the task
>     

These new formatters allow showing the stage and task status columns as a label.

For more details on how to configure the new column display formatters, you can read the [view column section](04-QflowTask.html#columns).

## Login with Qflow[](#inicio-de-sesion-con-qflow "Link to this heading")

With the goal of enhancing our users’ experience and streamlining the registration and login processes for Qflow, this version implements a new security provider into the system. The “Qflow” provider is included by default in all workspaces created in the Cloud version of the product, allowing users to log in using their credentials from our client registration site.

> [![Qflow security provider](_images/53News_QflowSecurityProvider.png)](_images/53News_QflowSecurityProvider.png)
> 
> Fig. 51 Qflow security provider[](#id6 "Link to this image")

System administrators can initially access the system using their registration site credentials, such as username or email, along with their password. Users created later can also use this provider if configured in Qflow Team with the Login set to their client registration site account email.

## Qflow Design: Revamped home and new gallery of pre-created templates[](#qflow-design-home-renovada-y-nueva-galeria-de-plantillas-pre-creadas "Link to this heading")

As creators of digital tools, we always strive for excellence in the quality and presentation of our products. Hence, we continue to innovate the visual design of Qflow, with significant changescoming to Qflow Design in this version.

The home page of Qflow Design has been redesigned to allow quick access to some of the existing pre-created templates, making it easier for our users to engage in the core activity of the tool: process design.

With the inclusion of the artificial intelligence assistant for process generation, we have also added a direct shortcut to it from the home page, enabling users to swiftly access its functionality.
