# Redmine[](#redmine "Link to this heading")

## Introduction[](#introduccion "Link to this heading")

The purpose of this manual is to detail how to configure and integrate Qflow with Redmine to allow interaction between both platforms, allowing users to create and update issues.

Redmine has the following actions:

*   [Create issue](#id1)
    
*   [Update issue](#id2)
    
*   [Delete issue](#id3)
    

## Prerequisites[](#prerrequisitos "Link to this heading")

It is necessary to have a Redmine installation and a user with permissions to create and update issues.

## Application parameter[](#parametro-de-aplicacion "Link to this heading")

To establish the connection it is necessary to have at least one **application parameter** (see [Application parameters](15-QflowDesign.html#parametros-de-aplicacion)) that allows to establish communication between Qflow and Redmine. This field is used to configure the connector of a Service Task in Qflow. (see [Configuring Connectors from a Service Task](35-ConnectorParameterConfig.html))

To create a Redmine application parameter, the following steps are required.

### Application parameter using API Key[](#parametro-de-aplicacion-utilizando-api-key "Link to this heading")

This type of application parameter requires the following parameters:

*   **Redmine Url**: Link with which you access the Redmine service
    
*   **API Key**: Key to access Redmine services
    

To obtain them, the following steps must be followed:

1.  Access Redmine and copy the link from the main page. For example, https://redmine.my\_organization.com/.
    
2.  Go to My Account

    Fig. 826 My Account marked on the home page[](#id4 "Link to this image")
    
3.  Click on Show in the API Key section and copy the API Key.

    Fig. 827 API Key marked on the My Account page[](#id5 "Link to this image")
    
4.  If you cannot see the API Key section, it is possible that the Redmine API is disabled. To enable it, you must access Administration -> Settings -> API and enable the option Enable REST web service.

    Fig. 829 API -> Enable REST web service marked on the Settings page[](#id7 "Link to this image")
    
5.  In Qflow Design, enter the link to Redmine and the API Key obtained as connection parameters.

    Fig. 830 Data added in the application parameter[](#id8 "Link to this image")
    

Once the steps are completed, it will be possible to use Redmine with Qflow.
