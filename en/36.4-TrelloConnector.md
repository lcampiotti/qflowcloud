# Trello[](#trello "Link to this heading")

## Introduction[](#introduccion "Link to this heading")

The purpose of this manual is to detail how to configure and integrate Qflow with Trello to allow interaction between both platforms, allowing to create, move, delete cards, add comments, add and remove members.

Trello has the following actions:

*   [Create card](#id1)
    
*   [Add comment to card](#id2)
    
*   [Move card](#id3)
    
*   [Add member to card](#id4)
    
*   [Remove member from card](#id5)
    
*   [Delete card](#id6)
    

## Prerequisites[](#prerrequisitos "Link to this heading")

It is necessary to have a Trello account and a workspace created on the platform. You can create an account [here](https://trello.com/signup).

## Application parameter[](#parametro-de-aplicacion "Link to this heading")

To establish the connection, it is necessary to have at least one **application parameter** (see [Application parameters](15-QflowDesign.html#application-parameters)) that allows establishing communication between Qflow and Trello. This parameter can be created from the service task configuration in Qflow. (see [Connector Configuration from a Service Task](35-ConnectorParameterConfig.html))

To create a Trello application parameter, the following steps are required, as detailed below.

### Application parameter using API Key and Token[](#parametro-de-aplicacion-utilizando-api-key-y-token "Link to this heading")

This type of application parameter requires the following parameters:

*   **API Key**: It is a key that allows Qflow to connect to the Trello workspace for which the key was created.
    
*   **Token**: It is an access token that allows Qflow to access the workspace
    

To obtain them, the following steps must be followed:

1.  Access the [Power-Ups and integrations](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin) section of Trello, read and accept the Trello Developer Terms.
    
    [![_images/TrelloConnectors1.png](_images/TrelloConnectors1.png)](_images/TrelloConnectors1.png)
    
    Fig. 810 Trello Developer Terms selected in Privacy and Compliance[](#id7 "Link to this image")
    
2.  Select New to create a new integration.

    Fig. 811 New selected in Power-Ups and integrations[](#id8 "Link to this image")
    
3.  Fill in the required fields for the integration creation.

    Fig. 812 Create selected in New Power-Up or integration[](#id9 "Link to this image")
    
4.  Once the integration is created, generate a new API key.
    
    [![_images/TrelloConnectors4.png](_images/TrelloConnectors4.png)](_images/TrelloConnectors4.png)
    
    Fig. 813 Generate a new API key selected in Power-Ups and integrations[](#id10 "Link to this image")
    
5.  Select that you want to generate the API key.

    > 
    > Fig. 814 Generate a new API key selected[](#id11 "Link to this image")
    
6.  Trello shows the API Key, which is the API Key to copy necessary to configure the Qflow application parameter. Once this is done, an access token must be generated by selecting Token.

    > 
    > Fig. 815 Where to copy API Key and Token selected in Power-Ups and integrations[](#id12 "Link to this image")
    
7.  The permissions that we will give to the integration when using the token we will create are listed. Select Allow
    
    > [![_images/TrelloConnectors7.png](_images/TrelloConnectors7.png)](_images/TrelloConnectors7.png)
    > 
    > Fig. 816 Allow selected in permissions section[](#id13 "Link to this image")
    
8.  Copy the generated token, which is the access token necessary to configure the Qflow application parameter. With this, the necessary steps on the Trello website are completed.
    
    > [![_images/TrelloConnectors8.png](_images/TrelloConnectors8.png)](_images/TrelloConnectors8.png)
    > 
    > Fig. 817 Copy the selected Token[](#id14 "Link to this image")
    
9.  In Qflow Design, add API Key and Token in the creation of the application parameter.

    > 
    > Fig. 818 Required parameters of the application parameter added in Qflow[](#id15 "Link to this image")
    

Once the steps are completed, it will be possible to create, move, delete cards, add comments, add and remove members in Trello from Qflow.
