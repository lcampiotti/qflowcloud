# Outlook[](#outlook "Link to this heading")

## Introduction[](#introduccion "Link to this heading")

The purpose of this manual is to detail how to configure and integrate Qflow with Outlook to enable interaction between both platforms, allowing the creation, updating, and cancellation of meetings in the calendar.

Outlook features the following actions:

*   [Schedule meeting](#id1)
    
*   [Update meeting](#id2)
    
*   [Cancel meeting](#id3)
    

See [Actions](36.2-OutlookConnector.html#id1) to learn about the description and content of each one.

## Prerequisites[](#prerrequisitos "Link to this heading")

A Microsoft account is required.

## Application parameter[](#parametro-de-aplicacion "Link to this heading")

To establish the connection, it is necessary to have at least one application parameter (see [Application Parameters](15-QflowDesign.html#parametros-de-aplicacion)) that allows communication between Qflow and Outlook. This field is used to configure the connector of a Service Task in Qflow. (see [Connector Configuration from a Service Task](35-ConnectorParameterConfig.html))

To create an Outlook application parameter, the following steps are required, as detailed below.

### Application parameter using OAuth[](#parametro-de-aplicacion-utilizando-oauth "Link to this heading")

This type of application parameter requires signing in to the Outlook account from Qflow. This is done in the connector configuration by following the steps of the OAuth flow.

Once the above steps are completed, it will be possible to interact with Outlook from Qflow.

## Actions[](#id1 "Link to this heading")

You can perform the following actions with Outlook:

### Schedule meeting[](#id2 "Link to this heading")
