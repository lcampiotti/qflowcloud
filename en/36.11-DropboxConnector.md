# Dropbox[](#dropbox "Link to this heading")

## Introduction[](#introduccion "Link to this heading")

The purpose of this manual is to detail how to configure and integrate Qflow with Dropbox to allow interaction between both platforms, thus allowing you to upload, consult and delete files in Dropbox.

Dropbox has the following actions:

*   [Upload file](#id2)
    
*   [Get file](#id3)
    
*   [Get link for web viewing](#id4)
    
*   [Delete file](#id5)
    

See [Actions](36.11-DropboxConnector.html#id1) for the description and content of each one.

## Prerequisites[](#prerrequisitos "Link to this heading")

It is necessary to have a Dropbox account. This can be done [from here](https://www.dropbox.com/register).

## Application parameter[](#parametro-de-aplicacion "Link to this heading")

To establish the connection it is necessary to have at least one **application parameter** (see [Application parameters](15-QflowDesign.html#parametros-de-aplicacion)) that allows communication to be established between Qflow and Dropbox. This parameter can be created from the service task configuration in Qflow. (see [Configuring Connectors from a Service Task](35-ConnectorParameterConfig.html)).

To create a Dropbox application parameter, the following steps are required.

### Application parameter using OAuth[](#parametro-de-aplicacion-utilizando-oauth "Link to this heading")

This type of application parameter requires loggin in to your Dropbox account from Qflow. This is done in the connector configuration following the steps of the OAuth flow.

Once the previous steps are completed, it will be posible interact with Dropbox from Qflow.
